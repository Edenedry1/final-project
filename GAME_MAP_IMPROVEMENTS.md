# Game Map Improvements - Updated Structure

## Overview
The DeepFake Audio Detection Game now features a completely uniform and balanced progression system with 5 questions per level across all 10 levels.

## New Level Structure

### Uniform Question Count
**All levels now have exactly 5 questions** for a consistent and balanced gaming experience.

### Progressive Difficulty System
Each level features increasingly sophisticated fake audio with higher quality:

| Level | Difficulty | Questions | Coins/Question | Max Coins | Description |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Beginner | 5 | 10 | 50 | Easy fake audio with obvious AI artifacts |
| 2 | Intermediate | 5 | 15 | 75 | Slightly better fake audio with subtle AI traces |
| 3 | Advanced | 5 | 20 | 100 | Better fake audio with minimal artifacts |
| 4 | Expert | 5 | 25 | 125 | High-quality fake audio that's hard to detect |
| 5 | Master | 5 | 30 | 150 | Very sophisticated fake audio with professional quality |
| 6 | Grandmaster | 5 | 35 | 175 | Near-perfect fake audio that fools most people |
| 7 | Legendary | 5 | 40 | 200 | Extremely convincing fake audio that's almost perfect |
| 8 | Mythical | 5 | 50 | 250 | Impossibly perfect fake audio with no detectable flaws |
| 9 | Cosmic | 5 | 75 | 375 | Reality-bending fake audio that defies human detection |
| 10 | Omniscient | 5 | 100 | 500 | Perfect fake audio indistinguishable from reality |

### Total Coins Available
- **Maximum possible coins: 2,000** (if all questions answered correctly)
- **Average expected coins: 1,000-1,200** (50-60% success rate)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Balanced Progression
- Consistent 5-question format eliminates confusion
- Clear difficulty progression from easy to impossible
- Rewards scale appropriately with difficulty

### 2. Fair Randomization
- Fake audio randomly placed on left or right side
- No predictable patterns for players to exploit
- True skill-based gameplay

### 3. Persistent Coin System
- Coins accumulate across all levels
- Saved in localStorage for session persistence
- Reset option available in main game menu

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Clear difficulty indicators with color-coded levels
- Progressive reward system motivates completion
- Uniform question count reduces confusion

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Randomization
```javascript
const fakeOnLeft = Math.random() < 0.5;
// Randomly assigns fake audio to left or right side
```

### Coin Persistence
```javascript
const [coins, setCoins] = useState(() => {
  const savedCoins = localStorage.getItem('totalCoins');
  return savedCoins ? parseInt(savedCoins) : 0;
});
```
